                <h2>Why Mornings Matter</h2>
                <p>
                    Many successful people swear by their morning routines. Whether it's meditation, journaling,
                    exercise, or simply a quiet cup of coffee — these rituals help set the tone for the rest of the day.

                <h2>Building Your Own Routine</h2>
                <p>
                    Start small. I Start  my day with a glass of luck warm water. Choosing 2–3 activities that energize or center me. I wake up 30 minutes earlier to
                    create space for these habits. Consistency is more important than intensity.

                <p>
                    With time, you'll notice improved focus, less stress, and a greater sense of control. Morning
                    routines can also boost your confidence as you check off small wins early in the day.
